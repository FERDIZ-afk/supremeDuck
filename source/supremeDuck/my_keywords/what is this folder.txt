You can put it in the Arduino libraries folder,
this way Arduino IDE will read "keywords.txt" and
it will nicely colour class/methods/literal names 

e.g. "WirelessModule" will turn orange.

Example of path:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries\my_keywords

You can modify "keywords.txt" to add your own stuff
to highlight.

It doesn't change functionality of the code.
It only makes more comfortable to read the code.
